# Requirements

## Software
* When being booted up our car Wi-Fi and MQTT connections should be established automatically. It should first connect to the Wi-Fi and after that it connects to the MQTT server. If problems were to occur the code on boot.py and main.py should be able to handle it.  
* After initiated bootup and start of the car, it should be driveable without further steps.  
* If any problem occurs during the procedures it should be handled with reconnect features.  
* The code should be written so that it can be understood and modified easily if needed. This includes descriptions.

## Build
* The body of the car should be able to withstand the weight of all components needed to sustain and drive the car.  \
* Parts should be easy to access and the wiring shall sit firmly in place so it won't cause problems when the car is driven.  \
* Material usage shouldn't be too high. Taking care of the environment by decreasing bad prints is a priority.  \
* The parts should be big enough so threads can be made to minimize use of glue and other adhesives. 

## Appearence
* The car should have a good looking appearance without compromising it's build or ability to move.
