We may not mention this in the rest of the text but it would be good to at least write a little about it.

The car was supposed to be controlled with an Android app via Bluetooth, so we don't have to do it via WIFI
Everything could be "local" but we couldn't connect the Lopy to the app.

We created two apps ourselves via a website that is called "MITT App Inventor".
Instead of one application, we created two applications just to make this work via BLE
One way or the other it was not possible to connect Lopy to the app or the app to Lopy. I asked for some help from our supervisor.

After many tries and tests with new information from one supervisor, we came to the conclusion that Lopy seems to be very limited to bluetooth applications.
Meanwhile, there is not so much documentations about BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) on the internet either so I was recommended to use the knowledge we learned in our assignments instead of BLE.
So we used Adifruit to control the car.

Images and codes for the applications will be in two separate folders, App_1 is the main app we wanted to use and App_2 is the backup
